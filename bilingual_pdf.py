""" This is a translation program that from user via terminal: a pdf filapath, language and engine.
    And it builts a new pdf that contains a table where each row is a paragraph of the original PDF.
    And each column:
        - The number of page and paragraph ex 2.1 is the first paragraph if the second page.
        - The original text.
        - The translated text.
    It is a pet project of someone who is learning Python, and doesn't know OOP yet. 
    And it was submeted on the EDX course CS50P as a final project.
    This version was finished on 29/09/2023 by Andrea Harit√ßalde.
